'''
The len() function is used to determine the length of a string or a list. In this case, it's applied to the string "Victoire".
When len('Victoire') is called, it calculates the number of characters in the string "Victoire", which is 8.
The variable count stores this value (8), and then print(count) displays 8 to the console.
